# Smart-Book-Reader

Individuals primarily have good vision where they can see the outer world easily and they can read and write normally. Braille script is created for visually impaired to read and write just like other people who have normal sight. Visually impaired (VI) according to WHO (2023) data 15 million people with significant vision loss.
The Braille system consists of cells with six raised dots, and each raised dot has a number from one to six organized in two columns. It is vital to allow visually impaired people to keep pace with the world around them. Providing Braille-assisted technology and integrating it in daily living are necessary to make the lives of visually impaired people more comfortable and efficient for communicating with others. After collection of Braille datasets, it is pre-processed where the noise or disturbances in the script is processed and removed. Later, the braille script is segmented and converted to individual characters and it is converted to other specified Indian language script and this is converted as voice output. By this we can focus on multiple languages and convert other language braille script to voice output. For this we can use IoT and deep learning, where support for multiple users can be provided.

The main problem addressed by this project is the difficulty faced by blind individuals or those with low vision when it comes to reading books. Braille is the language used to read books by visual impairment people by touch. This difficulty is overcome by “smart book reader for Visual Impairment People using IoT Device and Deep Learning’’ where the visual impaired people can easily be understood by audio.

OBJECTIVES

• Accessibility and User-Friendly Design.

• Text Recognition Accuracy.

• Real-Time Text-to-Speech Conversion.

• Environmental Adaptability.

• Continuous Learning and Improvement.

• Support for multiple languages, providing users with the flexibility to read content in their preferred language.

• Utilization of IoT Support for multiple users on a single device, making it suitable for shared environments such as classrooms or community centres.
